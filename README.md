# warpdriveJS
Warpdrive is a small, lightweight Canvas engine, with the purpose of making Canvasworks a little bit easier. It has no dependencies on anything, no external libraries, nothing.

The most advanced usage of the library (as a PoC) you can see on the [Asteroids: Warzone Demopage](http://play.asteroids.online).

# Usage
- grab the .js file in bin
- Instanciate a new Warpdrive Instance (see the code in src/app.js for further information)

Currently, there are no Docs outside of the code. They might get created if the demand increases.
