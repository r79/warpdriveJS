Copyright might still apply to Netstream AG, even though most of the stuff has been created in my free time. Definitely ask before usage, to not get crushed by some crazy lawyer.

Warpdrive is a small, lightweight Canvas engine, with the purpose of making Canvasworks a little bit easier. It has no dependencies on anything, no external libraries, nothing.

The most advanced usage of the library (as a PoC) you can see on the asteroids.warzone demo (http://play.asteroids.online).
